# BigDataAnalytics

**üßæ Project Overview**

The "Nutrient_Analysis_FoodItems" project aims to analyze the nutritional composition of various food items using PySpark, a distributed data processing framework.
The system efficiently handles large datasets, performs data cleaning, transformation, and clustering to identify patterns among nutrients such as proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and vitamins.
While it doesn‚Äôt directly implement the traditional MapReduce model, PySpark‚Äôs internal execution engine is based on the MapReduce paradigm.
By applying techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-Means Clustering, the project provides meaningful insights into the similarity of food items based on their nutrient profiles.
This analysis can help in food categorization, diet planning, and understanding nutritional relationships between food groups.
